The preceding stack trace is the source of the JAX operation that, once transformed by JAX, triggered the following exception.

--------------------

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

jax.errors.SimplifiedTraceback: For simplicity, JAX has removed its internal frames from the traceback of the following exception. Set JAX_TRACEBACK_FILTERING=off to include these.

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:
